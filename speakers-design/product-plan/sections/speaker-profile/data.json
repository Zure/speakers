AI agents are a core concept in these workflows. This session is covered with hands on demos of building your own multi agent workflows, connecting to MCP servers, using LLMs in Azure and all without writing any actual code.",

In this session, we go on a developer's quest to stay relevant in a world where AI can write code, review pull requests, and even reason about solutions. This is an honest look at the challenges ahead and an invitation to rethink our role.",

OpenCode does not store your code or context by default and is not tied to a single provider. In this session we'll show how developers can use OpenCode to have agents help design and build applications while keeping control over their data and tooling.",

It makes it possible for agents in your applications or in your development process to work with APIs, databases, and services in a structured way. We will show step by step how to build your own MCP server using .NET and C#, so you can bring custom functionality into your own AI agents.",

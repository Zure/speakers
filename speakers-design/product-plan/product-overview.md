# Product Overview

## Product Name
Zure Speakers & Sessions

## Description
A public-facing, view-only website that showcases Zure's speakers and their sessions, helping event organizers, conference planners, and companies discover engaging speakers and topics for their events. Data is automatically generated from an existing system—no authentication or manual data entry required.

## Problems We're Solving

### For Event Organizers & Companies
- **Hard to discover available speakers**: Event organizers struggle to find qualified speakers on specific topics without personal connections or lengthy research
- **No centralized view of expertise**: Companies looking for speakers have to piece together information from LinkedIn, personal websites, and word-of-mouth
- **Unclear session offerings**: Even when finding a speaker, it's unclear what topics they cover and what sessions they offer

### For Zure
- **Hidden talent**: Zure's expert consultants and their speaking expertise isn't visible to the market
- **Missed opportunities**: Potential speaking engagements are lost because event organizers don't know Zure has experts on their needed topics
- **No showcase platform**: There's no unified way to promote Zure's thought leadership and expertise
